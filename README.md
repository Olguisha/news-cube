## Goal
Developing a website and physical prototype that will show 6 different perspectives on the same news story and displaying the same news story from different sources. 
The aim is to create a tool to help navigate the news in the increasingly polarized world we live in and help escape our echo chambers.
I will use the NewsCatcher API (https://newscatcherapi.com/) to get news headlines and descriptions.
